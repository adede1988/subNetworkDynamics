function [outSet] = formCleanIdx(curS)
        %useful function for transforming a set of cluster labels into the "canonical form"

        %input:
        %   curS: vector of cluter IDs where -1 indicates noise/
        %         unclustered and positive integer values indicate 
        %         different cluster labels

        %output:
        %   outSet: vector with the same length and information as the input
        %           but with labels transformed to meet Strehl and Ghosh's "canonical form" 

        %suggested by Strehl and Ghosh 2002: 
        %(i) LAMBDA1 = 1; (ii) for all i = 1, ... , nâˆ’1 : LAMBDAi+1 <= maxj=1, ... ,i(LAMBDAj)+1.
        %The first constraint enforces that the first object's label is cluster 1. The second constraint
        %assures that the cluster label LAMBDAi+1 of any successive object xi+1 either has a label that
        %occurred before or a label that is one greater than the highest label so far. By allowing
        %only representations that fulfill both constraints, the integer vector representation can be
        %forced to be unique. Transforming the labels into this `canonical form' solves the combining
        %problem if all clusterings are actually the same."
